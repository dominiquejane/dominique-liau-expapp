Information on the overall design
- single-page application for recording expenses
-list/table of expenses
-add an item
-change status when reimbursed
-editable boxes for merchant, amount, date, comments

Assumptions made
-no crazy dates would be input
-no checks that the expense amount is in USD format/numbers only

Improvements you feel would be needed
-create/open a confirm window when reimbursing to make sure

Extra improvements:
-when editing the edits aren't reflected in the list array in the service, this would need to be reflected especially if there was a database. However, since there is no database and the information is not persisting this seemed unneccessary.
-add in a date picker
-add in sorting/filtering options
